"""AssemblyAI v3 streaming transcription: parser + websocket client.

This module contains two layers:

1. A pure parser — ``TranscriptEvent`` + ``parse_assemblyai_message`` — that
   decodes AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming v3 JSON messages into user-facing
   transcript events. Zero Qt / async / network dependencies; unit-tested in
   isolation.
2. ``TranscriptionClient`` — a ``QObject`` that owns the websocket lifecycle:
   fetches a short-lived token from the Cloudflare Worker, opens the v3
   websocket, runs concurrent send / recv loops, and emits ``interim_transcript``
   / ``final_transcript`` / ``error`` Qt signals. ``start_stream`` and
   ``stop_stream`` are ``async def`` coroutines designed to be kicked off from
   Qt signal handlers via ``asyncio.ensure_future`` once the app has wired
   Qt's event loop to asyncio with ``qasync`` (runtime dependency; not imported
   here).

See the Swift reference implementation at
``leanring-buddy/AssemblyAIStreamingTranscriptionProvider.swift`` for the exact
URL format, query-parameter names, termination frame protocol, and the
one-shot reconnect strategy this client mirrors.
